CUSTOMIZED VERSION OF PIPLIZ' FILES, MODIFICATIONS ARE MINE AND MAY OR MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR BUG FREE. THE GOAL OF THIS FORK IS TO MAKE (AT A MINIMUM) THE FOLLOWING CHANGES:

1) Replace some textures (such as trees) that look just terrible.
2) Allow builders and diggers to be used by players from the start of the colony.
3) Modify and/or add jobs in a way that makes a colony seem more like a colony of humans rather than androids.

# Colony Survival
Public gamedata files for Colony Survival

Mostly used as a repository to send pull requests for translation updates. Preferably these pull requests should be set to the highest versioned branch, and not to any 'live' branches (those are supposed to be fixed to a build).

Modding help [here](gamedata/help/mod_general.txt)

Check [localecoverage](gamedata/localization/localecoverage.md) for data on how complete the various translations are.
Files will have keys starting with "\_MISSING\_" followed by the english version for missing/untranslated text.
Localecoverage will be updated after pull request merges.

To add a new locale:
1) Preferably use a text editor like notepad++, as for example notepad does not properly support UTF-8 encoding.
2) Make a new folder under gamedata/localization/ and copy-paste the .json files over from the en-US locale.
3) Replace all the strings on the right side with the language you're translating it to.
